# About Myself

My name is Remzi Osman Gönültaş.I am currently playing American Football in Istanbul Tech Hornets.I am interested in sports like crossfit,yoga.
I graduated from Istanbul Technical University Mathematics Engineering department in January 2020.
Following my internships and employment experiences, I've opted to pursue a career in data science. Because data science fascinates me, I give special attention to my course selections and studies in this discipline. For a deeper grasp of my knowledge in this field, please see my linkedin profile.

## Review of useR 2021: Machine Learning and Data Management (Hanf, Alexander Bernd)

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn and improve on their own without having to be explicitly programmed. Machine learning is concerned with the creation of computer programs that can access data and learn on their own.In this video packages for machine learning in R explained like mlr3,automl the package for automated machine learning in R.Mlr3 is a powerfull,object oriented and extensible framework for ml.It has a rich package ecosystem providing general-purpose ml tools.Secondly lecturer introduce us automl which is tool for automating machine learning workflows like model selection.It provides baseline models with little effort.I did not know that R has this kind of packages in ml.Here is a link to the video

### Three R-posts relevant to my interests:

## 1-Simple Linear Regression in R

On the basis of a single predictor variable x, simple linear regression is used to predict a quantitative outcome y. The objective is to create a mathematical model (or formula) that specifies y as a function of x.Once we've created a statistically significant model, we can use it to forecast future outcomes based on new x values.In this article one cand understand how that can be done in R.

## 2-Exploring data

Data exploration is the first step in data analysis, during which data analysts apply data visualization and statistical tools to define dataset characterizations like size, volume, and accuracy in order to gain a better understanding of the data.

Both manual analysis and automated data exploration software solutions are used to visually explore and identify relationships between different data variables, the structure of the dataset, the presence of outliers, and the distribution of data values in order to reveal patterns and points of interest, allowing data analysts to gain a better understanding of the raw data.In this page packges,tools for data exploring in R explained.<https://geanders.github.io/RProgrammingForResearch/exploring-data-1.html>



## 3-Data Wrangling

Data wrangling, also known as data munging, is the means of transforming and mapping data from one "raw" data type into another with the goal of making it more suitable and profitable for downstream applications such as analytics. The purpose of data wrangling is to ensure that the data is of high quality and useful. When it comes to data analysis, data analysts generally spend the majority of their time wrangling data rather than really analyzing it.In this data wrangling explained<https://r4ds.had.co.nz/wrangle-intro.html
